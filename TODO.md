# To-Dos
-   Add a way to add intro text or other information to the generated docs (maybe a way to pull in markdown? straight HTML?)
-   Use Jinja2 template to run the TOC generator
-   Figure out how metadata can be added to the RAML spec's documentation
*NOTE:* Look at envelopes with localhost:9000/content/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F<org>%2F<repo>%2F<permalink> from the integrated deconst.
