# To-Dos
-   Get the coding done...
-   Remove copy-pasta stuff
-   Add a way to add intro text or other information to the generated docs (maybe a way to pull in markdown? straight HTML?)
-   Use Jinja2 template to run the TOC generator
-   Add comments to code for readability
-   Add docstrings to methods for autodoc and help
-   Look into updating to the latest alpine (3.5.x at the moment)
-   Figure out how metadata can be added to the RAML spec's documentation
